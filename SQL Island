In this project, I used SQL to figure out how to escape from an island after a crash landing from an online free game called SQL island

--To view how many villages are on the island
SELECT *
FROM village

-- To view view a list of all inhabitants
SELECT * 
FROM inhabitant

-- Find a butcher to ask for free sausages
SELECT *
FROM inhabitant
WHERE job = 'butcher'

-- Who are friendly inhabitants on the island?
SELECT * 
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly'

-- Find a friendly weaponsmith to get a sword from
SELECT * 
FROM inhabitant
WHERE state = 'friendly' AND job = 'weaponsmith'

-- Find a list of different people who can craft swords
SELECT *

-- What is your personid?
SELECT personid
FROM inhabitant

-- How much gold do you have?
SELECT gold
FROM inhabitant

-- Make a list of ownerless items you can sell to earn gold.
SELECT *

-- Collecgt all the ownerless items
UPDATE item

-- Display the list of items you own
SELECT *

-- Update the items with the new owner id
UPDATE item
SET owner = 15
WHERE (item = 'ring' OR item = 'teapot')

--"Unfortunately, that's not enough gold to buy a sword. Seems like I do have to work after all. Maybe it's not a bad idea to change my name from Stranger to my real name before I will apply for a job."
-- Update name to real name:
UPDATE inhabitant
SET name = 'Erin'
WHERE personid = 20

-- "Since baking is one of my hobbies, why not find a baker who I can work for?"
SELECT *

ORDER BY gold desc

-- "Is there a pilot on this island by any chance? He could fly me home."
-- Find who the pilot is:
SELECT *

-- Find out the chief's name of village Onionville
SELECT i.name

-- How many women are there in Onionville?
SELECT count(*)

-- "Oh, only one woman. What's her name?"
SELECT name

-- "Oh no, baking bread alone can't solve my problems. If I continue working and selling items though, I could earn more gold than the worth of gold inventories of all bakers, dealers and merchants together. How much gold is that?"
SELECT SUM(inhabitant.gold)

-- "Very interesting: For some reason, butchers own the most gold. How much gold do different inhabitants have on average, depending on their state (friendly, ...)?"
SELECT state, AVG(gold)

-- Heeeey! Now I'm very angry! What will you do next, Erin?
-- Delete Dirty Diane:
