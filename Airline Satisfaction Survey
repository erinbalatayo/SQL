-- The database used for this project is on Airline Passenger Satisfaction and may be found on Maven Analytics 
-- Airline Passenger Satisfaction
-- Customer satisfaction scores from 120,000+ airline passengers, including additional information about each passenger, their flight, and type of travel, as well as ther evaluation of different factors like cleanliness, comfort, service, and overall experience.


-- To start off this project, I will query all columns and limit a return of 20 rows. This is to explore the dataset and understand what values lies within it.
SELECT *
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
LIMIT 20;

-- Next, out of curiousity, I want to check how many rows of data exist in this database. (129,487)
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction;

-- Now to begin EDA (exploratory data analysis). Looking at a variety of things.. Female to male ratio, sastifacation rate, first time vs returning...alter

SELECT gender, 
	COUNT(*)
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY gender;

-- How many of these males and females are satisfied?
SELECT gender, 
	satisfaction,
	COUNT(*) quantity
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY gender, satisfaction 
ORDER BY quantity DESC;

-- What percentage of customers are satisfied with their trip?

-- STAKEHOLDER QUESTIONS
#1. Which percentage of airline passengers are satisfied? Does it vary by customer type? What about type of travel?

SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction; -- 43.4% is satisfied

-- by customer gender: male vs female? 
SELECT gender,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY gender; -- males are slighly more satisfied with their flight than females


-- Customer type?
SELECT `Customer Type`,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY `Customer Type`; -- returning customers are more satisfied than first-time customers.


SELECT gender,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY gender; -- males are slighly more satisfied with their flight than females

-- What about age?
SELECT 
	CASE 
    WHEN age <20 THEN '0-20'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 40 THEN '20-40'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 40 AND 60 then '40-60'
    ELSE '61+'
    END AS age_range,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY age_range
ORDER BY age_range; -- those between the ages 20-60 are more likely to be satisfied with their flight compared to those younger than 20 and older than 61. 

-- What about type of travel?
SELECT `Type of Travel`,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN satisfaction = 'satisfied' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS satifaction_percent
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY `Type of Travel`; -- people who flew business are more satisfied than those who flew on a personal flight 

# 2. What is the customer profile for a repeating airline passenger?
SELECT gender,
	CASE 
    WHEN age <21 THEN '20 and younger'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 20 AND 40 THEN '20-40'
    WHEN age BETWEEN 40 AND 60 then '40-60'
    ELSE '61+'
    END AS age_range,
    COUNT(*) as quantity
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
WHERE `Customer Type` = 'Returning'
GROUP BY gender, age_range;

-- What is the ratio between female and male returning passengers?
SELECT ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN gender = 'female' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS percent_female,
	ROUND(COUNT(CASE WHEN gender = 'MALE' THEN 1 END)/COUNT(*) * 100,1) AS percent_male
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
WHERE `Customer Type` = 'Returning';

#3. Does flight distance affect customer preferences or flight patterns?
SELECT 
	`Type of Travel`,
	CASE
    WHEN `Flight Distance` < 3000 THEN 'Short Flight'
    ELSE 'Long Flight'
    END AS flight_type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY `Type of Travel`, flight_type
;

SELECT 
	class,
	CASE
    WHEN `Flight Distance` < 3000 THEN 'Short Flight'
    ELSE 'Long Flight'
    END AS flight_type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM airline_passenger_satisfaction
GROUP BY class, flight_type
;
