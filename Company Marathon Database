-- In this project, I queried from a database containing fictional group of coworkers who ran in a marathon sponsored by a fictional company.

#1. Select every participant name and the percent of the marathon that they completed.

SELECT participant_name,
	completion_fraction*100 percent_complete
FROM marathon;

#2. Select every participant name and the percent of the marathon that they completed. Show the percent of the marathon completed rounded to one decimal place.

SELECT participant_name,
	ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) percent_complete
FROM marathon;

#For this query, show how many employees completed each quarter of the marathon (75% or more, 50%, 25%, or under 25%).

SELECT COUNT(*) as num_employees,
	CASE 
    WHEN ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) >=75 THEN '75% or more'
    WHEN ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) >=50 THEN '50% or more'
    WHEN ROUND(completion_fraction*100,1) >=25 THEN '25% or more'
    ELSE 'Under 25%'
    END as quarter_completed
FROM marathon
GROUP BY quarter_completed;
