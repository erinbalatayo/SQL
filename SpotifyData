-- For this project, I used Kaggle to download Spotify data
-- Then created a table to insert the data into
-- Lastly, I performed analytics on the data using SQL by creating my own questions to answer

--Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--After, I imported the Spotify Data .csv into the table 
--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL code:
SELECT * 
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata

--First, I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track
SELECT artist_name, track_name, AVG(popularity), AVG(danceability), AVG(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name;

-- Who are the top 10 artist by popularity?
SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.SpotifyData
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 10;

-- What were the top 5 songs in 2021?
SELECT track_name, artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity desc
LIMIT 5;

-- Which artist have more than one track on the Top 50 list?
SELECT count(artist_name) as songs, artist_name
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING songs >1
ORDER BY songs desc;


-- What was the average length of the top 50 songs? (Display in seconds)
SELECT avg(duration_ms)/1000
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata;

-- What is the average key used in Doja Cat's tracks?
SELECT avg(key)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Doja Cat'

-- What is the least popular song by Olivia Rodrigo listed on the Top 50 list?
SELECT min(popularity), track_name
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name = 'Olivia Rodrigo'
