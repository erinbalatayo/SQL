# For this project, I downloaded Spotify date from Kaggle: 
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into
# Finally, I performed analytics on data using SQL.

#Creating the table:
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL )

# Then I inserted the Spotify data .csv into the table 
# Next, I explored the data using the following SQL.

# First, I determined the avg popularity, danceability, and energy by artist and track

SELECT artist_name, track_name,
    avg(popularity), avg(danceability), avg(energy)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, track_name

# Then, I deteremined the top 10 artists by popularity

SELECT artist_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name, popularity
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

#Then, I determined the top 5 songs by popularity

SELECT track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY popularity DESC
LIMIT 5

# I was curious if the duration of the song has an effect on the popularity of the song. However, as a result there is no correlection since the popular songs range between 2-3 minutes, with the longest song in the database being 4 minutes. 

SELECT track_name, popularity, duration_ms/60000 AS 'duartion(min)'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY 'duration(min)', popularity DESC
LIMIT 5;

# Next, I wanted to determine if danceability has an effect on the popularity of the song. As a result, there is no correlation between danceability and popularity of a song.

SELECT track_name, popularity, danceability
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY danceability, popularity DESC
LIMIT 10;

# Then, I determined the artist who had the most songs featured in the Top 50 list in 2021. 

SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS 'num_featured'
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) DESC;

# As a result, Doja Cat and Olivia Rodrigo were tied with 4 featured songs. 
# Then, I determined their top 4 songs by popularity

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
WHERE artist_name IN ('Doja Cat', 'Olivia Rodrigo')
GROUP BY artist_name ,track_name, popularity
ORDER BY artist_name, popularity DESC;

#Then, I determined which artist have at least more than one song featured in the Top 50 list.

SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name) AS num_featured
FROM BIT_DB.spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING num_featured>1
ORDER BY num_featured DESC;
