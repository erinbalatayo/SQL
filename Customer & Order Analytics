#In this SQL code, I am querying a database with multiple tables regarding customer information and monthly sales to answer the following statistical questions.

--How many orders were placed in January? Remember to filter out the blank and incorrect order IDs like we did in the "dealing with messy data" section of the previous lesson!
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID IS NOT NULL 
    AND orderID <> ' ';
    

--How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
    AND orderID IS NOT NULL 
    AND orderID <> ' '
    AND product = 'iPhone';
    
--Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT distinct acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers AS cust
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales AS Feb
ON cust.order_id=feb.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid IS NOT NULL
    AND orderID <> ' ';


--Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT product, MIN(price)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderid IS NOT NULL
    AND orderID <> ' ';

--What is the total revenue for each product sold in January? (Revenue can be calculated using the number of products sold and the price of the products).
SELECT product
    , ROUND(SUM(quantity*price),2) AS revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderid) = 6
    AND orderID IS NOT NULL
    AND orderID <> ' '
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY revenue desc;
