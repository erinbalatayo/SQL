# Nova Retail, a United Kingdom-based e-commerce company, is conducting a website redesign to enhance conversion rates and user engagement. The experiment focuses on testing the impact of changing the websiteâ€™s background color from white (Group A) to black (Group B) on key metrics: conversion rate, pages viewed per session, and bounce rate. Each group in the test included a sample size of 2,481 users.

# The theory behind the test is rooted in user experience design, as darker backgrounds are often associated with a modern, sleek aesthetic that may reduce visual strain and help users focus on content. The analysis was carried out in collaboration with the web development and marketing teams using SQL, Python, and Tableau to derive actionable insights from the data.

# Overview of data set
SELECT *
FROM ab_testing;

# Checking total users in each group
SELECT DISTINCT `group`, 
	COUNT(*) 
FROM ab_testing
GROUP BY `group`; -- group A has more than group B

# Checking to see if there are duplicate users
SELECT `user id`
FROM ab_testing
GROUP BY `user id`
HAVING count(`user id`) >1; -- no duplicates.

# The sample size of both groups are not even. 
# Down-sample via Python --> new dataset balanced_ab_testing_data
# After down-sampling group A with python, the below query will confirm whether the sample sizes are equal
